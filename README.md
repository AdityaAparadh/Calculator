# Calculator

I'm learning to program using the tkinter library in python. This calculator project is just for learning. I'm also trying to get used to git and github. The latest stable version is regularly updated to the master branch. Calc_add_features branch is used to experiment and stabilize new features. Checkout for yourself ;-)
